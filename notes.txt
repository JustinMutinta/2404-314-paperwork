You need to create an environment for this, otherwise django-admin will not work.
The command for this is python -m venv env
This command is for windows.
env is the name of the virtual environment. choose whatever you want

env\Scripts\activate
This will activate the virtual environment

then pip install Django
nuff said.

django-admin
will list all the possible commands you want.

django-admin startproject paperwork
This creates the project for "paperwork"
I moved the env folder into the paperwork folder.

cd into the paperwork folder

python manage.py runserver
This will run the server for django
