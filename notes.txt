You need to create an environment for this, otherwise django-admin will not work.
The command for this is python -m venv env
This command is for windows.
env is the name of the virtual environment. choose whatever you want

For mac, its pip3 install virtualenv
then virtualenv mac_env to create the env
then source mac_env/bin/activate
if you get a permission error, do chmod +x mac_env/bin/activate


env\Scripts\activate
This will activate the virtual environment

then pip install Django
nuff said.

django-admin
will list all the possible commands you want.

django-admin startproject paperwork
This creates the project for "paperwork"
I moved the env folder into the paperwork folder.

cd into the paperwork folder

python manage.py runserver
This will run the server for django

python manage.py startapp projects
starts a new app named projects
